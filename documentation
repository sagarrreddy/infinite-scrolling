Project Name: Infinte Scrolling
Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, API, Bootstrap & GIT
Description:
This project is coded in such a way that when a user reaches to the bottom of the page, stories are added dyanmically which are fetched from the server. This gives a never ending feeling to the user.

I will just walk through my files and its need:

1) "index.html" contains the html code.
2) "images" folder contains all images used.
3) "css" folder contains the css files.
4) "js" folder contains the js files.

1) index.html:

In this file there are 3 sections:
1) Header
2) Body
3) Footer

CSS links are included in the head tag.
JS links are included right before closing the body tag.


2) images:

In this folder you can get all the images used during entire project/

3) css:

In this folder it contains custom.css which is a stylesheet for the complete project.

4) js:

In this folder it contains custom.js which contains all functions/events used. I used jQuery library. So it contains jquery code also.

Note: This is my first release. There is still many more to come like animation effect, masonry grid etc which really gives a smooth experience. So stay tuned!
Thank you!
